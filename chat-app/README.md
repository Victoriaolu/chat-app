Websocket the magic behind the chat application
Websocket a technology that allows open interactive communication sessions between a user's browser and a server.
A WebSocket creates a persistent, bidirectional communication channel between a web browser and a server. This technology allows web applications to exchange data with the server instantly, without the need for the client to initiate new HTTP requests or for the page to be reloaded. WebSocket maintains an open connection, allowing data to be sent back and forth as long as both the client and server deem it necessary
WebSocket is a communications protocol that allows for a constant flow of data over a single TCP connection.
let’s break for a few definitions:

TCP – A Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) allows messages between Internet devices within a network to communicate with each other. Most of the web applications that we are most familiar with today, such as browsers and emails, depend on TCP as part of the Internet’s communication transport layer.
Client – The Client refers to whatever application you have open on your device (such as your favorite video game, trading app, or social media feed).
Server – A server simply means a remote computer that stores the data that you want to receive or send.
WebSockets allow for a continuous line of communication between the client and server until that line is closed. As a result, it can remain open for back and forth, bi-directional communications.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine
Basic knowledge of JavaScript and React
Step 1: Create a New React Application
Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app:
npx create-react-app chat-app
Navigate into the project directory:
cd chat-app
Step 2: Set Up the Backend
Create a new directory for the backend:
mkdir server
cd server
Initialize a new Node.js project
npm init -y
Install the necessary dependencies:
npm install express socket.io cors
Create a file named server.js and set up a basic server
Set Up the Frontend
Install Socket.IO client in the React app:
npm install socket.io-client
Create a new file named Chat.js in the src directory.
Update App.js to include the Chat component
Styling with css file.
Running the Application
Open two terminal windows.
In the first terminal, navigate to the server directory and start the backend server:
cd server
node server.js
In the second terminal, navigate to the root of your React app and start the frontend:
cd chat-app
npm start
navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view your chat application.
